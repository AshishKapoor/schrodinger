# Schrodinger

A cats gallery app.

1. Picked up NextJS since the application isn’t currently behind any authentication system yet.
2. Using SWR instead of react-query because it goes well with NextJS. Otherwise, I’d have picked up react-query to cache my fetch queries.
3. About the UI, I got the main feature in the middle of the page with basic CSS and a nearly dumb logic.
4. Made use of NextJS's cool server to get the fixture date over network.

### TODO: -

1. Find some fancy loader (Skeleton UI) or something quick to represent the loading state.
2. Make use of react grid layout or react draggable for the drag and drop feature.
3. Find some overlay library for react or make use of [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).
